# IS-project

This project is developed as part of an academic Information Security course. It demonstrates how phishing attacks work for educational purposes only and aims to raise awareness about cybersecurity threats and the importance of secure practices online.

The project includes:  
- Instagram Login Page Clone  
- Facebook Login Page Clone  
- 8 Ball Pool Login Page Clone  
- Redirection Mechanism: The 8 Ball Pool page redirects users to either the Instagram or Facebook phishing login pages.  
- Firebase Integration: All cloned login pages are connected to Firebase to store data securely.  

> Disclaimer: This project is intended solely for learning and research purposes. It is not intended for malicious use.  

 Features  
- Cloned UI for popular login pages (Instagram, Facebook, 8 Ball Pool).  
- Firebase integration for data handling and storage.  
- Redirection functionality between pages for seamless phishing simulation.  
- Built using React.js for the front end.  

Technology Stack

- Firebase: Used for backend and data storage.  
- HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the web pages.  

How It Works
1. Users land on the 8 Ball Pool login page.  
2. Depending on their actions, they are redirected to either the Instagram or Facebook phishing login pages.  
3. Submitted data is sent to Firebase for demonstration purposes.
