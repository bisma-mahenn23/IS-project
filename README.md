This project is developed as part of an academic Information Security course. It demonstrates how phishing attacks work and aims to raise awareness about cybersecurity threats and the importance of secure practices online.

The project includes:  
- Instagram Login Page Clone  
- Facebook Login Page Clone  
- 8 Ball Pool Login Page Clone  
- Redirection Mechanism: The 8 Ball Pool page redirects users to either the Instagram or Facebook phishing login pages.  
- Firebase Integration: All cloned login pages are connected to Firebase to store data securely.
